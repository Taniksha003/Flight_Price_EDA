Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze flight price data to:

Identify factors affecting flight prices.
Perform data preprocessing and cleaning.
Engineer meaningful features for better analysis.
Generate visualizations for effective communication of findings.
Dataset
Source: Publicly available flight price datasets (e.g., Kaggle or similar).
Description: The dataset contains information about airlines, routes, flight durations, departure/arrival times, prices, and other flight attributes.
Tech Stack
Python: Core programming language
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive analysis
Libraries:
pandas - Data manipulation
numpy - Numerical computations
scikit-learn - Machine Learning 
Analysis Steps
Data Loading:

Import the flight price dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing or null values.
Remove duplicates, if any.
Format and standardize date, time, and categorical fields.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understand the distribution of flight prices.
Analyze trends related to flight duration, airlines, and departure timings.

Feature Engineering:

Create new features, such as flight duration in hours, day/night departure, and airline-specific price averages.
Encode categorical features for machine learning readiness.
